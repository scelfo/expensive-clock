Expensive Clock
---------------

Demo application written by Tony Scelfo (tony@tonyscelfo.com) showing how to
use the closure compiler to build a compiled/obfuscated javascript application
and launch it on app engine.  The application allows someone to create a large
HTML5 animated clock that spans across multiple monitors, such as eight macbook
pro laptops sitting next to each other.

Check out the source and run "compile.sh" or "concatenate.js" to fetch all the
closure dependencies and then produce application javascript code from the
javascript source files in the src/ directory.  Make sure that you run one of
these scripts to create application javascript in the js/ folder, otherwise the
application will not work.

The app engine application is configured with app.yaml and can be imported into
the standard google app engine launcher by choosing "File -> Add Existing
Application..."

The latest version can be seen running at http://expensiveclock.appspot.com/

Enjoy!
